  description: >-
    API definition for USP's restaurants.  This isn't an official resource. It
    was created by the Jopiter team as a tool to help integration with USP's
    poor and unopened API. We did a lot of digging on how it works so you don't
    have to. <br /> <br /> The original API was extracted from USP's
    Restaurant's APP ([Card√°pio
    USP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.usp.cardapio_usp)).
    <br /> At the current version, the decompiled `HASH` is
    `596df9effde6f877717b4e81fdb2ca9f`.  It's used for all authentication within
    USP's APIs. Whenever (and if) it's changed, this page will be updated
    accordingly.
